## Payment App Clone (Backend & Frontend)

This project is a basic clone of a payment application similar to Paytm, focusing on replicating core functionalities without the UI design. It uses React for the frontend and Express for the backend.

### Features

* **User Registration and Login:** Users can create accounts and log in using secure authentication.
* **Account Management:** Users can view their account balance and profile information. (Expand on this based on your implemented functionalities)
* **Money Transfer:** Users can send and receive money between accounts. (Optional: Specify supported methods, e.g., bank account transfer, UPI)
* (Add functionality points specific to your clone here)

**Note:** This is a basic clone and may not include all the features of a full-fledged payment application. 

### Technologies Used

* Frontend: React
* Backend: Express.js
* (Specify additional technologies used, e.g., database - MongoDB, authentication - JWT)
